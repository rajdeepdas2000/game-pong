This is my first ever game created with pygame module of Python
The rules and controls are simple:
1.Player 1(left) moves the paddle up and down with W and S keys respectively.
2.Player 2(right) moves the paddle up and down with UP and DOWN arrow keys respectively.
3.When a player misses to hit the ball, the opposite player scores a point.
4.Press X key to close the game.
5.Have fun
